indicators
==========
Important indicators for digital marketing.

Invites sent
-----
The amount of invites sent.
Can generally only be significantly improved by providing a service people love enough to recommend to their friends.

Installs
-----
The amount of installations.

Invitation rate
-----
The invitation rate is #invites / #installs (users). It denotes the average number of invites sent per user, and can generally only be significantly improved by providing a service people love enough to recommend to their friends. Example: if 1250 users sent in total 2000 invites, the invitation rate is (2000/1250)=1.6.


Invitee signups
-----
The amount of signups provided by invites.

Acceptance rate
-----
The acceptance rate is #invitee signups / #invites. It is a measure of the success of your invites. Ways to improve this may include better invitation emails, smoother signup process, signup incentives, etc. Example: if out of the 2000 invitees, 580 new users signed up, the acceptance rate is (580/2000)=0.29.

The Viral Coefficient
-----
The acceptance rate is #invitee signups / #invites. It is a measure of the success of your invites. Ways to improve this may include better invitation emails, smoother signup process, signup incentives, etc. Example: if out of the 2000 invitees, 580 new users signed up, the acceptance rate is (580/2000)=0.29.

The Viral Cicle Time
-----
The average time between receiving an invite and sending an invite (completing one full iteration of the viral loop). Obviously, the shorter this time the better.
