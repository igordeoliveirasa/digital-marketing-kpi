Digital Marketing Key Performance Indicators
==========
Important indicators for digital marketing.

Invites Sent
-----
The amount of invites sent.
Can generally only be significantly improved by providing a service people love enough to recommend to their friends.

Installs
-----
The amount of installations.

Invitation Rate
-----
The invitation rate is #invites / #installs (users). It denotes the average number of invites sent per user, and can generally only be significantly improved by providing a service people love enough to recommend to their friends. Example: if 1250 users sent in total 2000 invites, the invitation rate is (2000/1250)=1.6.


Invitee Signups
-----
The amount of signups provided by invites.

Acceptance Rate
-----
The acceptance rate is #invitee signups / #invites. It is a measure of the success of your invites. Ways to improve this may include better invitation emails, smoother signup process, signup incentives, etc. Example: if out of the 2000 invitees, 580 new users signed up, the acceptance rate is (580/2000)=0.29.

The Viral Coefficient
-----
The acceptance rate is #invitee signups / #invites. It is a measure of the success of your invites. Ways to improve this may include better invitation emails, smoother signup process, signup incentives, etc. Example: if out of the 2000 invitees, 580 new users signed up, the acceptance rate is (580/2000)=0.29.

The Viral Cicle Time
-----
The average time between receiving an invite and sending an invite (completing one full iteration of the viral loop). Obviously, the shorter this time the better. 

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
----- 
The cost of acquiring a new customer. It is one of the key inputs that feeds into calculating CLV. To be sustainable and profitable, a business must seek to ensure that their CLV is higher than their CAC and continue to re-assess this ratio as it fluctuates. 

While knowing CAC is useful for many reasons, it is more useful when leveraged to accurately measure the CLV of a particular customer. After all, acquisition cost doesn’t match expected ROI if that new user isn't into your brand for the long-haul (or at least just a longer than today haul).

In essence, by incorporating CAC into the CLV calculation, a company can determine whether a specific consumer is going to be profitable or not. The company can then spend their targeted marketing dollars toward those valuable customers by launching specific promotions and campaigns. Not only does this better target valuable customers, but it also allows a business to more accurately evaluate the effectiveness of launching a specific campaign. In other words, CLV calculations aren't just about the long-term. They help to prove the value of a campaign before it is launched, ensuring you get the ROI you need to invest in the spend.

Churn Rate
-----
Churn rate (sometimes called attrition rate), in its broadest sense, is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period of time. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support. The term is used in many contexts, but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base. For instance, it is an important factor for any business with a subscriber-based service model, including mobile telephone networks and pay TV operators. The term is also used to refer to participant turnover in peer-to-peer networks. Churn rate is an important input into customer lifetime value modeling, and can be part of a simulator used to measure Return on Marketing Investment using Marketing Mix Modeling.

Imagine you got the same 100 customers to stick around for a second year: all else being equal you’d make $40,000 from the same group.

In the above example we’re assuming the churn rate is 0% – i.e. all 100 customers stay for both years.

Instead, imagine if your churn rate increased to and 10% of your customers left after the first year. You’d only make $38,000 over the two years. Likewise, if your churn rate was 20% you’d only make $36,000.

Although oversimplified, this example shows that keeping your churn rate as low as possible will have a dramatic impact on your revenue!

Average Customer Lifespan Calculation
-----
Customer lifespan is important because If you double your customer lifespan you double your revenues. 

The Customer Lifetime Value
-----
Customer Lifetime Value measures the profit your business makes from any given customer.
To calculate it, take the revenue you earn from a customer, subtract out the money spent on serving them, and adjust all of the payments for time value of money.

Customer lifetime value helps you make important business decisions about sales, marketing, product development, and customer support. For example:

1 - Marketing:
How much should I spend to acquire a customer?

2 - Product:
Who are my best customers? How can I offer products and services tailored for them?

3 - Customer Support:
How much should I spend to service and retain a customer?

4 - Sales:
What types of customers should sales reps spend the most time on?
